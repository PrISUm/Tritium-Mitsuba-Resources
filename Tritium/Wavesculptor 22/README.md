The WaveSculptor22 motor drive is a high-efficiency, low-weight, three-phase 14kW variable frequency inverter especially designed to drive high-efficiency, low-inductance, permanent magnet motors.

It is a third generation product, with its predecessor, the WaveSculptor20, used by nearly all leading solar racing car teams worldwide, with an excellent reputation for reliability and performance.

Key performance improvements in the new WaveSculptor22 include:

    1/2 the power loss
    1/4 the weight
    1/5 the volume

The WaveSculptor22 provides you with more flexibility and the potential to better integrate the controller into your vehicle. Any heat generated by the motor controller is extracted via a cold plate on the base, giving you the ability to optimise the cooling system for your particular vehicle. This gives you a wide range of options for cooling, from air or liquid, to using the vehicle itself as a heatsink.

The suite of firmware, software and ancillary products that form the WaveSculptor drive system work seamlessly together to make the motor controller easy to configure, and compatible with a wide range of electric motors.
