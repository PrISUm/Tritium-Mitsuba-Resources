The WaveSculptor200 is an extremely reliable, powerful, light-weight and ultra-compact three phase motor controller. It can drive an AC permanent magnet motor or AC induction motor with a peak power of 165kVA and an average of over 75kVA.

Wiring the WaveSculptor 200 into a vehicle is simple. Apart from the high power cabling, the WaveSculptor 200 only has a single connection to the vehicle — the CAN bus connector. The CAN bus is used to command the vehicle, broadcast telemetry, configure the controller and update the firmware.

A powerful user interface makes configuring the controller simple. Tuning wizards, provided as part of the WaveSculptor software suite, tune the controller to the selected motor. This allows the WaveSculptor to be used with any number of different induction or permanent magnet motors.

Having evolved from the high performance arena of solar car racing, the WaveSculptor200 is full of features not found on other motor controllers in the market. It controls motor current, vehicle speed, battery current, and reduces battery current flow to keep within the maximum and minimum pack voltage. By working in conjunction with our IQcell BMS it can do the same for the individual cells.

The WaveSculptor200 is designed to be mounted under the vehicle’s bonnet and is therefore water and dust proof. All cooling is provided via a liquid cooling loop.
