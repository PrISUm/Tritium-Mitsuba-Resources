Tritiumâ€™s CAN-Ethernet bridge allows easy access from a PC application to the vehicle CAN bus. It utilises multicast UDP/IP to communicate between PC applications and the bridge, which allows multiple PC applications to connect to the CAN bus at once using only one CAN-Ethernet bridge. As UDP/IP is built into any modern operating system, no special driver installation is required.

The structure of the CAN/Ethernet network is extremely flexible. The bridge can be connected to the PC point to point, over a local network or even via the internet. With multiple bridges in use, it can be used to form a virtual link between two physically separated CAN networks. Shown below is an example network configuration using the Tritium CAN-Ethernet bridge.
